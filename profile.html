                Moving a lot throughout my childhood is one of the things that have taught me about resilience and adapting to change.
                This has also lead to a need for constant challenge, to satisfy the need to challenge myself I am constantly learning and honing my skills in different ways.
                Learning new things and practicing the things I've learned is very important to me and has become a source of meditaion.
                TED talks, audio books, podcasts, documentaries, and fixing things have been an integral part of who I am for years; I have been taking things apart and putting them back together in different ways for as long as I can remember.
                My ability to adapt to change and learn has lead me to playing important roles in the companies I've been a part of.

                        This position held many responsibilities and required me to be knowledgable in almost every aspect of buisness operations. 
                        Reporting problems with building maintenaince was a core responsibility and something that was practiced almost daily.
                        Report writing followed specific guidlines set by the company we were contracted to work with, these guidlines involved date and times of incidents and detailed descriptions of said incidents.
                        My involvement in report writing decreased a backlog of problems that had been forgotten about for over three years.
                        In this position my superiors and I saw an increase in morale in the workspace from the start of my role.

                        Cabinetry is an art that is slowly starting to fade into time; custom woodwork is something that takes a good appreciation for fine details, and an eye for the bigger picture.
                        While handeling tools is an important aspect to woodworking I've found that having a mind for creativity and a love for creating something beautiful is far more important to a successful carpenter.
                        Something very important to note about that is the attention to fine detail isn't the only skill necessary to a succesfull carpenter, being able to see how those details come together is the important part of carpentry.
                        Before my employment orginization and operations were inconsistent and lead to time management issues, this lead to most projects having late completion.
                        After my employment operations were streamlined and organization became a priority which contributed to project completion being on time or early.

                        As a line cook in an artisanal pizza restaurant I learned a lot about working with a team to achieve a goal.
                        This was an extremely rewarding experience which has contributed greatly to who I am today.
                        There is no better way to learn how to work as a team than to get in the kitchen during dinner rush, the communication and speed needed is nothing short of amazing when watching professionals.
                        Every aspect of a meal needs to come together with timing and quality in mind which means not only a heavy attention to detail but working in fast paced environment for hours with very short time constraints.
                        Stress management and teamwork are no doubt the most valuable skills I have gained as a line cook.

                Moving a lot throughout my childhood is one of the things that have taught me about resilience and adapting to change.
                This has also led to a need to constantly challenge myself; to satisfy the need to challenge myself I am constantly learning and honing my skills in different ways.
                Learning new things and practicing the things I've learned is very important to me and has become a source of meditation.
                TED talks, audio books, podcasts, documentaries, and fixing things have been an integral part of who I am for years; I have been taking things apart and putting them back together in different ways for as long as I can remember.
                My ability to adapt to change and learn has led me to playing important roles in the companies I've been a part of.

                        This position held many responsibilities and required me to be knowledgeable in almost every aspect of business operations. 
                        Reporting problems with building maintenance was a core responsibility and something that was practiced almost daily.
                        Report writing followed specific guidelines set by the company we were contracted to work with, these guidelines involved date and times of incidents and detailed descriptions of said incidents.
                        My involvement in report writing decreased a backlog of problems that had been forgotten about for over three years.
                        In this position my superiors and I saw an increase in morale in the workspace from the start of my role.

                        Cabinetry is an art that is slowly starting to fade into time; custom woodwork is something that takes a good appreciation for fine details, and an eye for the bigger picture.
                        While handling tools is an important aspect to woodworking, I've found that having a mind for creativity and a love for creating something beautiful is far more important to a successful carpenter.
                        Something very important to note about that is that the attention to fine detail isn't the only skill necessary to a successful carpenter, being able to see how those details come together is the important part of carpentry.
                        Before my employment organization and operations were inconsistent which created deadline issues, this lead to most projects having late completion.
                        After my employment operations were streamlined and organization became a priority which contributed to project completion being on time or early.

                        As a line cook in an artisanal pizza restaurant I learned a lot about working with a team to achieve a goal.
                        This was an extremely rewarding experience which has contributed greatly to who I am today.
                        There is no better way to learn how to work as a team than to get in the kitchen during dinner rush, the communication and speed needed is nothing short of amazing when watching professionals.
                        Every aspect of a meal needs to come together with timing and quality in mind which means not only a heavy attention to detail but working in fast a paced environment for hours with very short time constraints.
                        Stress management and teamwork are no doubt the most valuable skills I have gained as a line cook.

            <p class="text-content">
                This is a self guided project made from scratch using HTML and CSS.
                In this project I did my own research into the fundamentals of website design including the use of fonts, colors, navigation menus, and an overview of Fitt's law and how it is utilized to enhance user experience(UX).
                While practicing my HTML and CSS I was able to learn about different aspects of web design and I was able to incorporate some of those principals into this project.

            <p class="text-content">
                This project relies heavily on JavaScript for calculations and denominations of change from a cash register.
                This was a certification project from <a rel="freecodecamp.org" target="_blank" href="https://freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>.
                A project that will certainly test anyone's abilities with computation in JavaScript; I decided to take it a step further by creating a functional keypad with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                This keypad would inject numbers into a number input defined in HTML, featuring cancel and purchase buttons in the keypad.

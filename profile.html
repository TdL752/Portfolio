            </h2>
            <p class="text-content">
                Moving a lot throughout my childhood is one of the things that have taught me about resilience and adapting to change, while working with horses has taught me a lot about patience and courage.
                These are just a few of the skills I had a head start at learning; these core skills have led to a love of learning new things and an ability to embrace change.
                While I will never be able to learn or know everything, my goal is to learn as much as I can and to chase the things I love.
                Programming, coding, and design has become a newfound love; over the past year I have spent as much time as I could learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                This has been difficult, with me and my fiance working full time with our 14 month old daughter I would work second shift and complete courses after getting home, then I would wake up with my daughter and do it all again.
                My fiance was able to find a new job that could support us both and give us the ability to watch our daughter ourselves.
                This came with the added benifit of me being able to spend more time preparing for a new career.

                        This position held many responsibilities and required me to be knowledgeable in almost every aspect of business operations. 
                        Reporting problems with building maintenance was a core responsibility and something that was practiced almost daily.
                        Report writing followed specific guidelines set by the company we were contracted to work with, these guidelines involved date and times of incidents and detailed descriptions of said incidents.
                        My involvement in report writing decreased a backlog of problems that had been forgotten about for over three years.
                        In this position my superiors and I saw an increase in morale in the workplace from the start of my role.

                        Cabinetry is an art that is slowly starting to fade into time; custom woodwork is something that takes a good appreciation for fine details, and an eye for the bigger picture.
                        While handling tools is an important aspect to woodworking, I've found that having a mind for creativity and a love for creating something beautiful is far more important to a successful carpenter.
                        Something important to note about that is that attention to detail isn't the only skill necessary to a successful carpenter, being able to see how those details come together is the important part of carpentry.
                        Before my employment organization and operations were inconsistent which created deadline issues, this lead to most projects having late completion.
                        After my employment operations were streamlined and organization became a priority which contributed to project completion being on time or early.

                        As a line cook in an artisanal pizza restaurant I learned a lot about working with a team to achieve a goal.
                        This was an extremely rewarding experience which has contributed greatly to who I am today.
                        There is no better way to learn how to work as a team than to get in the kitchen during dinner rush, the communication and speed needed is nothing short of amazing when watching professionals.
                        Every aspect of a meal needs to come together with timing and quality in mind which means not only a heavy attention to detail but working in fast a paced environment for hours with very short time constraints.
                        Stress management and teamwork are no doubt the most valuable skills I have gained as a line cook.

                My goal is not only to practice what I've learned but also to utilize projects to learn more.

                This is a self guided project made from scratch using HTML and CSS.
                In this project I did my own research into the fundamentals of website design including the use of fonts, colors, navigation menus, and an overview of Fitt's law and how it is utilized to enhance user experience(UX).
                While practicing my HTML and CSS I was able to learn about different aspects of web design and I was able to incorporate some of those principals into this project.

                This project relies heavily on JavaScript for calculations and denominations of change from a cash register.
                This was a certification project from <a rel="freecodecamp.org" target="_blank" href="https://freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>.
                A project that will certainly test anyone's abilities with computation in JavaScript; I decided to take it a step further by creating a functional keypad with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                This keypad would inject numbers into a number input defined in HTML, featuring cancel and purchase buttons in the keypad.
